This is just a simple implementation of the black-scholes model where you input the current price, volatility, time to expiry, interest rate, strike and you get the Call option price as well as the put option price.
You can also observe how the option prices change with the volatility and the spot price.

How to run ::
1) Fork repository
2) pip install the requirements {streamlit, pandas, numpy, scipy, plotly, matplotlib, seaborn}
3) run "streamlit run black_scholes_app.py"
